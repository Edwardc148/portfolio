          <p class"about-info">After graduating as a Bioengineer from the University of California, San Diego, I worked as a first responder. Over the course of three and a half years, I responded to over 2500 medical emergencies. I feel like I have done a lot of great work in the healthcare industry, and at this point in my life, I am ready for a different kind of challenge. In the ever changing software industry, there is always room for massive growth as corporations try to fashion their predictions for what is coming ahead. That is why as my first step into software development, I attended App Academy in San Francisco where I developed my skills as a software engineer with specialties in React, Redux, JavaScript, CSS, and Ruby on Rails in order to become an avid contributor to new and innovative technologies.</p>
